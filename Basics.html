					<h2>Computers Basics</h2>
				</header>
					
				<p>We use computers every day to make our lives easier. Now consider this statement: “Computers are everywhere”. 
				Does it sound like a cliché? An overstatement? No matter the perception about the impact of computers, the statement is true.  
				Computers are everywhere, in fact you can find them in pretty unlikely places including your family car, home appliances and alarm clocks.
				
				<figure>
					<img src="images/pcworld.png" width="660" height="300"/>
				</figure>
				
				Computers have evolved in the past decades and have reshaped our lives at home, work and school.
				A large number of businesses around the world make use of computers to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their
				output by means of a network internally or externally. 
				Many homes have also taken advantage of the cyberspace to make good use of computers by setting up home networks.

					<h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
				</header>

				<p>A Computer is an electronic device used for storing and processing data as a result of instructions given to it by
				a user. It takes in data in the form of binary, process it and outputs the results as information that is useful to 
				the user. Since a computer cannot reason or think, the output of its information is dependent on the data input. 
				That is to say if a user provides a computer with wrong data, the information rendered will be unpleasant or
				misleading, hence the acronym “GIGO” meaning Garbage in Garbage out.
				The importance of computers is undoubtedly overwhelming as it is used in every aspect of life including education, 
				health and medicine, science, business, recreation and entertainment, government, defense, sports, etc.

					<h2>Bits and Bytes</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>A computer is really nothing more than a series of switches. Each switch exists in two
					states: on or off. Storing information in a computer is simply a matter of setting a sequence of
					Switches on or off. If the switch is on, its value is 1. If the switch is off, its value is 0. These 0s
					and 1s are interpreted as digits in the binary number system and are called bits (binary digits). The minimum storage unit in a computer is a byte. A byte is composed of eight bits.
				</p>
				
				<figure>
					<img src="images/switches1.png"/>
				</figure>
				
				<p>
				A small number such as 3 can be stored as a single byte. To store a number that cannot fit into a
				single byte, the computer uses several bytes. Data of various kinds, such as numbers and characters, are encoded as a series of bytes automatically by the computer based on an encoding scheme. An encoding
				scheme is a set of rules that govern how a computer translates characters, numbers, and symbols
				into data the computer can actually work with. Most schemes translate each character into predetermined strings of bits. In the popular ASCII encoding scheme, for example, the
				character C is represented as 01000011 in one byte.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				A computer’s storage capacity is measured in bytes and multiple of bytes as follows;
				
				
					<ul>
						<li>A kilobyte (KB) is about 1000 bytes</li>
						<li>A megabyte (MB) is about 1 million bytes</li>
						<li>A gigabyte (GB) is about 1 billion bytes</li>
						<li>A terabyte (TB) is about 1 trillion bytes</li>
					</ul>
					
				A typical one-page word document might take 20 KB. Therefore, 1 MB can store 50_pages
				of documents and 1 GB can store 50,000 pages of documents. A typical two-hour high-resolution
				movie might take 8 GB, so it would require 160 GB to store 20 movies.

					<h2>Classification of Computers</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
				As we interact with computers, we observe that they appear in different sizes, , mode of operation and the purpose for which it was meant. This has led to the classification of computers. They are classified based on the following:
				
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Type of logic or Operating principles</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Size and capacity</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Purpose or area of application</strong></li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<div class="group">
					<header>
						<h3>Classification of computers based on Type of Logic/Operating Principles</h3>
					</header>
					
					<p>
						Based on the type of logic or operating principles, computers may be classified into one of the following:
							<ul>
								<li>Digital computers</li>
								<li>Analogue computers</li>
								<li>Hybrid computers</li>
							</ul>
							
						<p id="digital"><strong>Digital computers</strong> are those that use numbers in their operation. That is all quantities are expressed as discrete or numbers. They break all types of information into tiny units and use numbers to represent those pieces of information. Digital computer also work in very strict sequences of steps, processing each unit information individually, according to the highly organized instructions they must follow. They are very useful for arithmetic expressions and manipulation of data.
						</p>
						<figure>

							<figurecaption>Digital computer</figurecaption>
						</figure>
						
						<p id="analogue"><strong>Analogue computers</strong> on the other hand represent data as variable points along a continuous spectrum of values. That is they make use physical relations in representing data and makes them somewhat flexible than the digital ones, but not necessarily more precise or reliable.
						</p>
						
						<figure>

							<figurecaption>Analogue computer</figurecaption>
						</figure>
						
						<p id="hybrid"><strong>Hybrid computers</strong> are those systems that have features of digital computers and analogue computers. The digital part of a hybrid computer serves as the controller and provides logical operations while the analogue component usually serves as a solver of differential equations.

					<h3>Classification of computers based on size and capacity</h3>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					The size and capability of computers broadly group computers into the following:
					
						<ul>
							<li>Supercomputers</li>
							<li>Mainframe computers</li>
							<li>Minicomputers</li>
							<li>Microcomputers</li>
						</ul>
						
					<p id="supercomputers"><strong>Supercomputers</strong> are the most largest and powerful computers in the world. These systems can process large amounts of data and performing more than one trillion calculations per second. Some supercomputers can contain thousands of processors. Supercomputers are mainly used for large scale numerical problems in scientific and engineering disciplines as mapping human genome, weather forecast and modelling complex processes like nuclear fission.
					</p>

						<img src="images/supercomputer.jpg" width="400" height="250"/><br/>
						<figurecaption>Supercomputer</figurecaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p id="mainframecomputers">
					<strong>Mainframe computers</strong> are those that have large storage capacity and high speed processing compared to minicomputers and microcomputers. They are used in larger organizations such as banks and insurance companies where many users need to access the same data. With regards to the use of mainframe computers, users are able to access its resources by means of a device called terminal. There are two kinds of terminals namely; dumb terminal and intelligent terminal. A dumb terminal does not process or store data, it is simply an input/output (I/O) device that functions as window into a computer located somewhere else. An intelligent terminal can perform some processing functions but usually does not have any storage.
					</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="images/mainframe3.jpg" width="400" height="250"/><br/>
						<figurecaption>Mainframe computer</figurecaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>
					Powerful mainframes can handle the processing needs of thousands of users at a given time. Sometimes a worker can use a standard personal computer to access the mainframe. They lack flexibility and can be used to handle specific set of tasks. An ATM transaction is a typical interaction between a user and a mainframe system.
					</p>
					
					<p id="minicomputers">
					<strong>Minicomputers</strong> derived their name from their size compared to other computers. Their capabilities lie between that of a mainframe and personal computer and are therefore referred to as midrange computers. Minicomputers can handle and process large data than personal computers and can serve the input and output needs of hundreds of users at a time. People can access a standard minicomputer by means of a terminal or standard PC.
					</p>

					</figure>
					
					<p id="microcomputers">
					<strong>Microcomputers</strong>, also known as personal computers (PC) are to be used by one person at a time. Although personal computers can be used by individuals, they can also be connected together to create networks. Computers in this category include:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Desktops</li>
						<li>Workstations</li>
						<li>Notebook computers</li>
						<li>Tablet computers</li>
						<li>Handheld computers</li>
						<li>Smart phones</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
					<strong><em>Desktop computers</em></strong> are the type of microcomputers designed to sit on a desk or table. They are found in schools, offices and homes. Desktops in recent years are more powerful than those a few years ago as they can be used for extremely amazing tasks. They can be used to communicate, produce videos, edit images and play sophisticated games. As its name implies, a desktop computer is too big to be carried around. The essential components of a desktop computer are housed in box-like structure called system unit which consists of processing and storage components. The desktop computers come in two forms; the type that has the system unit horizontally oriented on the desk with the monitor on top and the most common type called tower pc where the system unit is placed vertically beside, under the desk or however desired.
					</p>

						<figurecaption>Desktop computers; vertical model (left) and horizontal model (right)</figurecaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>
					<strong><em>Workstations</em></strong> are specialized single-user computers that typically have more power than the standard desktop pc. They have greater average speed and are commonly used by scientist, engineers and animators to perform sophisticated tasks. Workstations often have high resolution and accelerated graphics features that make them suitable for architectural and engineering designs, modelling, video editing and animations.
					</p>

						<figurecaption>Computers at a workstation</figurecaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>
					<strong><em>Notebook computers</em></strong> are portable computers with an average weight between 3- 6kg and its mobility is enhanced by a briefcase or a bag. Because people mostly set these machines on their lap, they are often referred to as laptops. Notebooks or laptops are costly than desktop pc’s. They can operate on either alternating current or special batteries. During its use, the lid is opened to reveal a monitor and a keyboard. When not in use, the device folds up for easy storage. Notebooks are fully functional microcomputers and because of its portability, they fall into the category of PCs called mobile computers.
					</p>

					</figure>
					
					<p>
					<strong><em>Tablet PCs</em></strong>: The tablet PC is the newest development in portable, full featured computers. Tablet PCs offer all the functionality of a notebook PC but they are small in size, lighter and can accept input from a special pen- called stylus or digital pen- that is directly used to tap or write directly on the screen. Some tablet computers come with a fold-out keyboard making them appear more like a notebook PC. They can use special versions of programs that enable them to connect to networks and even external monitors.

					<p>
					<strong><em>Handheld</em></strong> PCs as the name implies are devices that are small enough to fit in the hand. A common type of handheld computer is the Personal Data Assistant (PDA). A PDA is no larger than a pocket or appointment book and is often used for special tasks such as taking notes, displaying telephone numbers and addresses and keeping track of dates and agendas. Many PDAs have special software that allow their connectivity with larger computers to enable data exchange. Most handheld PCs come with a pen that is used to touch and write on the screen and some also feature tiny in-built keyboards. Manu PDAs allow users to connect to the internet via wireless connection, with some others offering features like music players, cameras and global positioning systems (GPS).

					<strong><em>Smart Phones</em></strong>: Some cellular phones double as miniature PCs because they offer advanced features not often seen in cellular phones and are therefore referred to as smart phones. Some of these great features include web and Email access, cameras, music players, text editors and sometimes remote control applications.

						<h3>Classification of computers based on purpose or area of application</h3>
					</header>
					
					<p>
					Modern computer based on their area of application or purpose are grouped into:
					</p>
					
					<p>
					<strong><em>Special purpose computers</em></strong>: A special purpose computer is designed only to meet the requirements of a particular task or application. The instructions needed to perform a particular task are permanently stored into the internal memory, so that it can perform the given task on a single command. It therefore doesn’t possess unnecessary options and is less expensive. An example of a special purpose computer is a Nintendo video game or game console.
					</p>

						<figurecaption>A computer for a special task</figurecaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>
					<strong><em>General purpose computers</em></strong> A General Purpose computers are designed to perform multiple tasks with different programs at the same time. For instance, on single computer, a user can play video game and at the same time play music. In these computers, the instructions needed to perform a particular task are wired permanently into the internal memory. When one job is over, instructions for another job can be loaded into the internal memory for processing. This, a general purpose machine can be used to prepare pay-bills, manage inventories, print sales report and so on.

					<h2>Importance of Computers</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
				There are a list of countless reasons for the importance of computers. For someone with a disability, for example, a computer may offer freedom to communicate, learn or work without leaving home. For a sales professional, a PC may mean the ability to communicate when necessary, track leads, and to manage ever-changing schedules. A researcher may rely on a computer for all time-consuming. But if you take all the benefits people derive from computers and mix them together and distil them down to a single element, what would have? Well, the answer is simply information.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Computers are very important because information is so essential to our lives. Information goes beyond what see and hear and television. Letters containing texts and facts in a book are information. The plans for a building or the recipe for a cake. Songs, pictures, addresses, flyers, and documents are all regarded information because they can be processed and stored by the computers. So when you think of the importance of computers, consider the importance of information. With regards to creating new information and working with them, computers are one of the greatest inventions of humanity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<h3>Computer use in the home</h3>
				
				<strong><em>Communication</em></strong>: Electronic mail (e-mail) continues to be the most popular use of home computers because it allows family members and co-workers to be reach out to each other and keep in touch.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<strong><em>Business work done at Home</em></strong>: Thanks to computers, tasks at the work place are now being continued and completed at home due to lack of sufficient time at work. The internet has allowed for connectivity between a home computer and a computer at the work place.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<strong><em>School work</em></strong>: The idea of printed books for students to learn is gradually fading out as the internet has become a refuge for the nowadays students. Polished documents can now be created and even published online for easy access.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<strong><em>Entertainment</em></strong>: Playing computer games is very enjoyable if you happen to be a lover of PC games. People often play computer games with the aim of beating time or as a means of relaxation. Computers as a means of entertainment is gradually taking over the entertainment derived from television. The video, audio and other broadcast technology will one day be the source of home entertainment.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<strong><em>Finances</em></strong>: Computers have limited the frustrations associated with balancing of receipts, sales and workbooks. Lengthy calculations can be performed with the right applications.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h3>Educational use of Computers</h3>
					
					Educational systems in schools are adding computer technology to their curricula with the purpose of not only teaching and enhancing computer skills but also to apply in other fields of academics or study. Computer usage and its technology have become an essential learning requirement as seen by educators. Computing skills such as keyboarding and document creation are being taught in elementary schools now. High school leavers can go to colleges with a basic knowledge and understanding of computers which will tend to prepare them for further computer knowledge and skills like programming or coding.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h3>Small Businesses</h3>
					
					Small businesses of today have rely on computers to establish, employ and grow their market. Each year, thousands of people lunch their businesses and they do that by the use of computers. They rely on personal computers to perform basic work functions but to manage and grow their company.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h3>Industry</h3>
					
					One of the amazing things computers have contributed to is the utilization of programs such as computer robotics to manufacture products like vehicles, airplanes and sophisticated machinery. The use of a computer in an industry may be as follows: <br/>
					<strong><em>Design</em></strong>: Nearly any company that is into design and making products can make use of computer aided design in their creation <br/>
					<strong><em>Transportation</em></strong>: The transport of goods or products can be monitored with special computer software. Transportation companies use computers to manage their billing, vehicle location, content of a track making their transactions a whole lot easier.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h3>Government</h3>
					
					Not only are governments are big consumers of technology but they also help to develop it. Recently computers play a crucial part in nearly government agency: <br/>
					<strong><em>Taxes</em></strong>: The internal Revenue Service has opted for the use of computers to assist them keep records of tax payments, records and bills. Tax payments can be done online to reduce mechanical services. <br/>
					<strong><em>Population</em></strong>: Imagine a country trying to count the number of people. Not only will the population census personnel get tired, data may be lost. In view of this population census are now conducted with a computer aided software which can be used for tallying the population. <br/>
					<strong><em>Military</em></strong>: Some of the of the world’s most sophisticated computer technology has been developed primarily for use by the military. Some earliest digital computers were created for such purposes as calculating the trajectory of missiles. The armed forces use the widest array of computer hardware and software imaginable. <br/>
					<strong><em>Police</em></strong>: Today in battling crimes the police make use of intranet which is a kind of database network that can be used to keep records of crime incidents, criminals and even trace and predict future incidents.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h3>Health Care</h3>
					
					Pay a visit to a local hospital and you find yourself surrounded by computerized equipment of all kinds. In fact, computers are making health care efficient and accurate while helping providers bring down costs. Many health care services make use of computers from ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, to laser eye surgical. <br/>
					Surgeons can now use robotic surgical devices to perform very delicate operations. Not all computers used in health care centers are complex or high tech as they can be used to collect and gather information about a patient, manage record and perform billings. Many transactions between physicians and insurance companies and pharmacies are conducted by computers, saving health care workers time to devote to more important tasks.
